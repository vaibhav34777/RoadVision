# RoadVision 
**Semantic Segmentation + Object Detection for Intelligent Road Scene Understanding**

RoadVision is a deep learning-based web application that combines **semantic segmentation** and **object detection** to analyze road scenes from static images. Designed with real-world applications like autonomous driving and smart traffic systems in mind, this project leverages a U-Net-based segmentation model and a YOLO-based object detector to produce detailed and interpretable visual outputs.
